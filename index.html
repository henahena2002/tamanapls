      [Verse 1]
I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
<br> </br>
[Chorus]
I guess I'm stuck forever
By the glue, oh, and you
      <br> </br>
[Verse 2]
Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you
<br> </br>
[Chorus 2]
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by the glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by the glue
<br> </br>
[Outro]
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you, ooh
